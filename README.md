# Dashboard for Ontario's COVID-19 Data



Hi there! This is a personal project that aims to visualize data points from the publicly available dataset from the Ontario Government for the COVID-19 pandemic. It interacts with the data (available here: https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/f4f86e54-872d-43f8-8a86-3892fd3cb5e6/resource/ed270bb8-340b-41f9-a7c6-e8ef587e6d11/download) to provide a daily update on the number of new cases, the percent positive tests today and newly, the number of variant cases.

This will get updated periodically in terms of layout, but the functionality should remain the same nonetheless.

Thanks for checking this out! 

-- Update: Feb. 20 --
Vaccination data has been added.
