# Dashboard for Ontario's COVID-19 Data



Hi there! This is a personal project that aims to visualize data points from the publicly available dataset from the Ontario Government for the COVID-19 pandemic. It interacts with the data to provide a daily update on the number of new cases, the percent positive tests today, variant cases and vaccination progress.

This will get updated periodically in terms of layout, but the functionality should remain the same nonetheless.

Thanks for checking this out! 

-- Update: Sep. 13/21 --
Layout of the dashboard has been changed to allow viewing of specific data - e.g., vaccination-specific data.
